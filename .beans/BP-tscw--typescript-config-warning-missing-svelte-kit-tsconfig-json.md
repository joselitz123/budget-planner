## Problem

TypeScript configuration warning appears because `tsconfig.json` extends a file that doesn't exist initially: `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`.

### Warning Message

```
▲ [WARNING] Cannot find base config file "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json" [tsconfig.json]

    tsconfig.json:2:12:
      2 │   "extends": "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json",
        ╵              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Context

The `frontend/tsconfig.json` file extends `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`, which is a file that SvelteKit generates during the build process. However, this file doesn't exist initially when the `.svelte-kit` directory is cleared (e.g., by the `start.sh` script's cache clearing). The warning appears before the build completes, creating noise in the logs even though the file gets regenerated during the build.

This is not a critical issue as the file is automatically created by SvelteKit, but it creates unnecessary warnings in the development logs.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clear the `.svelte-kit` directory (e.g., `rm -rf frontend/.svelte-kit`)
2. Run `npm run dev` or start the development server
3. Observe the warning: "Cannot find base config file './.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json'"
4. Wait for the build to complete - the file will be created and the warning will not reappear

## Expected Behavior

Either:

1. The warning should not appear if the file will be generated during build
2. The TypeScript configuration should handle missing base config gracefully
3. The base config file should exist before TypeScript tries to extend it

## Actual Behavior

A warning appears every time the `.svelte-kit` directory is cleared and the development server is started, even though the file will be created during the build process.

## Root Cause

The `frontend/tsconfig.json` file has this configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json",
  ...
}
```

The `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` file is generated by SvelteKit during the build process, but TypeScript attempts to read the configuration before the build completes. When the `.svelte-kit` directory is cleared (as happens in `start.sh`), the file doesn't exist yet, causing the warning.

## Proposed Solution

There are several possible approaches to resolve this warning:

**Option 1: Suppress the warning (Quickest)**

- Add a comment in `tsconfig.json` acknowledging the warning
- Document that the file is generated by SvelteKit
- Accept the warning as expected behavior

**Option 2: Conditional extends (More complex)**

- Use a pre-build script to check if `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` exists
- If not, create a minimal placeholder before TypeScript runs
- This would require modifying the build process

**Option 3: Modify start.sh (Recommended)**

- Update `start.sh` to generate the `.svelte-kit` directory structure before starting the dev server
- Run `npm run build` or a similar command to ensure the file exists
- This ensures the config file is present before TypeScript tries to use it

**Option 4: Use TypeScript's config inheritance differently**

- Consider whether the extends is necessary or if the config can be copied directly
- This may not be feasible as SvelteKit manages this file

Given that this is a low-priority issue and the warning doesn't affect functionality, **Option 1** (documenting the warning) is likely the most pragmatic solution. However, **Option 3** (modifying start.sh) would provide the cleanest user experience.

## Files Affected

- `frontend/tsconfig.json` - May need documentation or config adjustment
- `start.sh` - Could be modified to ensure `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` exists before starting

## Related Issues

- None

## Impact

**Low** - This is a cosmetic issue that creates noise in the logs but does not affect functionality. The file is automatically generated by SvelteKit during the build process, and the warning does not prevent the application from running or TypeScript from working correctly.

## Fix Applied

**Status:** Completed on 2026-01-02

### Files Modified

- [`start.sh`](start.sh)

### Fix Description

Modified the `.svelte-kit` cache clearing logic in `start.sh` to preserve the `tsconfig.json` file. Instead of removing the entire `.svelte-kit` directory with `rm -rf`, the script now uses `find` to selectively remove only the build artifacts while keeping the TypeScript configuration file intact.

### Implementation

```bash
# Clear .svelte-kit cache but preserve tsconfig.json
if [ -d "frontend/.svelte-kit" ]; then
    echo "Clearing .svelte-kit cache (preserving tsconfig.json)..."
    find frontend/.svelte-kit -type f ! -name "tsconfig.json" -delete
    find frontend/.svelte-kit -type d -empty -delete
fi
```

This approach:

1. Removes all files in `.svelte-kit` except `tsconfig.json`
2. Removes empty directories after file deletion
3. Ensures the TypeScript config file exists before the dev server starts
4. Eliminates the "Cannot find base config file" warning
