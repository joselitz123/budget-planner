# Budget Planner

> An offline-first Progressive Web App for personal budget management

Budget Planner helps you take control of your finances with monthly budgeting, expense tracking, bill payment reminders, and collaborative budget sharing. Best of all, it works offline - your data syncs automatically when you're back online.

## Features

- **Monthly Budget Planning** - Create budgets by category and track spending against your limits
- **Expense Tracking** - Log expenses with categories, payment methods, and descriptions
- **Bill Payment Tracking** - Never miss a payment with due date reminders and status tracking
- **Monthly Reflections** - Review your financial health with structured monthly reflections
- **Budget Sharing** - Collaborate with family or friends by sharing budgets with view or edit permissions
- **Offline-First** - Works without an internet connection; syncs when you're back online
- **Analytics & Insights** - Visual breakdowns of spending by category and trends over time
- **PWA** - Install on your phone or desktop for a native app experience

## About

Budget Planner is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with a notebook-themed aesthetic. The offline-first architecture means all your data is stored locally on your device, and changes are synchronized with the server when you have an internet connection. This ensures the app remains responsive and functional even in areas with poor connectivity.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Required for running the PostgreSQL database
- **Node.js 18+** - For the frontend development server
- **Go 1.23+** - (Optional) For backend development; the startup script uses pre-built commands

## Quick Start

### Option A: Using the Startup Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the provided startup script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/budget-planner.git
cd budget-planner

# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- Check that Docker is running
- Start the PostgreSQL database
- Set up environment configuration files
- Install frontend dependencies (if needed)
- Start the backend server
- Start the frontend development server
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services when you're done.

### Option B: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/budget-planner.git
cd budget-planner

# 2. Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 3. Set up environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# 4. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# 5. Start the backend (in a new terminal)
cd ../backend
# If you have 'air' installed for hot reload:
air
# Otherwise:
go run ./cmd/api

# 6. Start the frontend (in a new terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

# 7. Open your browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The app uses environment variables for configuration. Copy the example files to get started:

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```bash
# Database (automatically configured by docker-compose)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://budgetuser:budgetpass@localhost:5432/budgetdb?sslmode=disable

# Server
PORT=8080

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production
JWT_ISSUER=budget-planner
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):
```bash
# API
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# PWA
PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Budget Planner
PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_NAME=Budget
```

### Authentication (Optional)

The app supports Clerk authentication for production use. To enable:

1. Create a free account at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Add your Clerk keys to the environment files:

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```bash
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):
```bash
PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
```

For local development without Clerk, the app uses JWT tokens generated by the backend.

## Usage

1. **Create an Account** - Sign up with your email or use the demo mode
2. **Set Up Your First Budget** - Create a monthly budget and allocate amounts to categories
3. **Track Expenses** - Add expenses as you spend, categorized for easy reporting
4. **Monitor Bills** - Add recurring bills and mark them as paid when due
5. **Reflect Monthly** - Complete the monthly reflection to review your financial progress
6. **Share Budgets** - Invite others to collaborate on shared budgets

## Development

Want to contribute or extend the app? See `CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive developer documentation.

**Run tests:**
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://budgetuser:budgetpass@localhost:5432/budgetdb?sslmode=disable" go test ./... -v

# Frontend type checking
cd frontend
npm run check
```

**Build for production:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)

The SvelteKit frontend can be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
vercel deploy
```

### Backend (Railway/Render/AWS)

The Go backend compiles to a single binary:

```bash
cd backend
go build -o budget-planner-api ./cmd/api
./budget-planner-api
```

For production, you'll need:
- A PostgreSQL database (e.g., Railway, Supabase, AWS RDS)
- Environment variables configured
- Clerk (or your preferred auth provider) set up
